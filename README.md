Run the tests for "Random Quote Machine"

Things to note:

With more time, I would try to better filter the jokes. This is supposed to print out IT based jokes.
Right now its possible distasteful, nsfw, or non-pc to be thrown into the mix based on the API call. I had tried to filter it out with modifiers on the URL from where i got the key, but they dont seem to do anything.


I would also fix the quotes changing color slightly faster than the rest of the screen, with no transition. It irked me when I noticed it >:( . 
I would also fix up some formatting when "&amp" appears. Also that tweeting doesnt actually work, I dont use twitter so I just did it to fulfill the assignment need.
